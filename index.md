Privacy Policy for ClarityDo

Effective Date: November 26, 2025

ClarityDo ("the App") is a free, offline todo list application developed by Mehmet Tekin. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information. By using the App, you agree to this policy.

1. Information We Collect
ClarityDo is designed to work entirely offline and does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All data (tasks, alarms, preferences) is stored locally on your device using Room database and DataStore. We do not access:
- Personal identifiers (e.g., name, email, location).
- Device information (e.g., IP address, device ID).
- Usage data or analytics.

No data is shared with third parties, servers, or cloud services. The App requires permissions for notifications and exact alarms solely to function (e.g., task reminders), but these do not involve data collection.

2. How We Use Information
Since no data is collected, there is no usage of personal information. Local data is used only for app functionality (e.g., displaying tasks, scheduling alarms via WorkManager).

3. Data Security
Your local data is protected by your device's security features. We recommend using device locks. In case of app uninstall, all data is deleted.

4. Children's Privacy
The App does not target children under 13 and complies with COPPA. No data collection occurs.

5. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy. Changes will be notified via app updates. Continued use implies acceptance.

6. Contact Us
For questions: mehmettekin59@gmail.com    

This App is provided "as is" without warranties. We are not liable for data loss.
